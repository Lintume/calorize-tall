# Laravel Sail Development Environment

This project uses Laravel Sail for local development with Docker.

## Important: Container Commands

Always run the following commands through the Sail container:

- **Composer**: Use `./vendor/bin/sail composer` instead of `composer`
- **Artisan**: Use `./vendor/bin/sail artisan` instead of `php artisan`
- **PHP**: Use `./vendor/bin/sail php` instead of `php`
- **NPM**: Use `./vendor/bin/sail npm` instead of `npm`

### Examples

```bash
# Install dependencies
./vendor/bin/sail composer install
./vendor/bin/sail composer require package-name

# Run artisan commands
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model ModelName

# Run tests
./vendor/bin/sail test
```

## Frontend Build Process

After making changes to frontend files (CSS, JavaScript, Blade templates, or any assets), always run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
```

**Exception**: Skip running `npm run build` if `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` is already running in the Cursor terminal, as the dev server will automatically rebuild on changes.
